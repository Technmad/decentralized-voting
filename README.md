# Decentralized Voting System

## Why do we need it?

Current voting systems like ballot box voting or electronic voting suffer from various security threats such as DDoS attacks, polling booth capturing, vote alteration and manipulation, malware attacks, etc, and also require huge amounts of paperwork, human resources, and time. This creates a sense of distrust among existing systems.

## Some of the disadvantages are:

1. Long Queues during elections.
2. Security Breaches like data leaks, vote tampering.
3. Lot of paperwork involved, hence less eco-friendly and time-consuming.
4. Difficult for differently-abled voters to reach polling booth.
5. Cost of expenditure on elections is high.

## Solution:

Using blockchain, voting process can be made more secure, transparent, immutable, and reliable. How? Let’s take an example.

Suppose you are an eligible voter (above 18 YO) who goes to polling booth and cast vote using EVM (Electronic Voting Machine). But since it’s a circuitry after all and if someone tampers with microchip, you may never know that did your vote reach to person for whom you voted or was diverted into another candidate’s account?

Since there’s no tracing back of your vote. But, if you use blockchain- it stores everything as a transaction that will be explained soon below; and hence gives you a receipt of your vote (in a form of a transaction ID) and you can use it to ensure that your vote has been counted securely.

Now suppose a digital voting system (website/app) has been launched to digitize process and all confidential data is stored on a single admin server/machine, if someone tries to hack it or snoop over it, he/she can change candidate’s vote count- from 2 to 22! You may never know that hacker installs malware or performs clickjacking attacks to steal or negate your vote or simply attacks central server.

To avoid this, if system is integrated with blockchain- a special property called immutability protects system. Consider SQL, PHP, or any other traditional database systems. You can insert, update, or delete votes. But in a blockchain you can just insert data but cannot update or delete. Hence when you insert something, it stays there forever and no one can manipulate it- Thus name immutable ledger.

But Building a blockchain system is not enough. It should be decentralized i.e if one server goes down or something happens on a particular node, other nodes can function normally and do not have to wait for victim node’s recovery.

## Advantages are listed below:

1. You can vote anytime/anywhere (During Pandemics like COVID-19) where it’s impossible to hold elections physically
2. Secure
3. Immutable
4. Faster
5. Transparent
